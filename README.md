# TERN Financial Group Inc. - Insurance Management System

## Project Overview
TERN Financial Group Inc. is an insurance company specializing in insurance products for the sharing economy, such as co-housing and short-term housing rentals. As part of their operations, they receive monthly reports detailing occupancy information for each insured location. Currently, this data is managed manually using spreadsheets, making it challenging to search, verify, and process records efficiently. 

Our project aims to streamline the management and billing processes for TERN Financial by providing an application that simplifies data handling. The system will allow employees to upload spreadsheets, manipulate data, generate billings based on policies and locations, and perform analytical queries on the stored information. This will enhance efficiency, reduce human error, and improve data accessibility.

## Key Features
- **Spreadsheet Data Import**: Employees can upload spreadsheets containing occupancy data, which will be converted into manipulatable records.
- **Data Querying & Modification**: Users can search, filter, and edit records based on specific criteria.
- **Billing Generation**: The system will generate invoices based on policies and country-specific regulations.
- **Analytical Queries**: The database will allow users to quickly analyze data, such as identifying insured units within a disaster-affected area.
- **Secure Access**: Only authorized TERN Financial employees will have access to the system.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The front-end will provide a clean and efficient interface for interacting with the data.

## Technologies Used
- **Database**: MySQL (Relational database for structured storage and efficient querying)
- **Backend**: PHP (Handles database interactions and core functionalities)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Provides an interactive user interface)
- **Data Handling**: CSV file processing for importing spreadsheet data
- **Security**: Authentication and authorization mechanisms to restrict access to authorized users only

## Benefits
- **Efficiency**: Automates data handling, reducing the time required for manual processing.
- **Accuracy**: Minimizes human errors in data entry and calculations.
- **Scalability**: The system can accommodate large datasets and increasing client demands.
- **Disaster Response Readiness**: Quickly identify affected units in case of emergencies.
- **User Accessibility**: Employees can easily search, view, and modify data as needed.

## Development Background
The skills required to develop this project have been and will continue to be acquired through relevant courses, including:
- **Programming Patterns** (Backend logic and structuring)
- **Database** (MySQL relational database management)
- **Internet Programming** (Web development with PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript)
- **eCommerce** (Secure transactions and billing systems)

## Client Liaison
